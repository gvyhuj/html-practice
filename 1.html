<p><strong><u><a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/" target="_blank" title="FC Barcelona homepage">Futbol Club Barcelona</a></u></strong>, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça, is a Spanish professional football club based in Barcelona, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.</p>
<p>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club").</p>
<p>Una like many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8 million.</p>
<p>The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes, leading to the nickname Blaugrana.</p>
